# StackUp Mobile App (Concept)

## Introduction

StackUp is a pioneering platform that empowers developers to learn, build, and earn through engaging quests and bounties. While StackUp has been successfully operating as a web platform, there hasn't been a dedicated mobile application to date. This project presents a conceptual mock-up of the StackUp mobile app, designed to bring the platform's core functionalities to the fingertips of users on the go.

## Features

### 1. Authentication

- **Sign Up**: New users can create their StackUp accounts directly from the mobile app.
- **Login**: Existing users can securely access their accounts.
