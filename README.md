# StackUp Mobile App (Concept)

## Introduction

StackUp is a pioneering platform that empowers developers to learn, build, and earn through engaging quests and bounties. While StackUp has been successfully operating as a web platform, there hasn't been a dedicated mobile application to date. This project presents a conceptual mock-up of the StackUp mobile app, designed to bring the platform's core functionalities to the fingertips of users on the go.

## Features

### 1. Authentication
- **Sign Up**: New users can create their StackUp accounts directly from the mobile app.
- **Login**: Existing users can securely access their accounts.

### 2. Campaigns and Quests
- Browse and view available campaigns.
- Access detailed information about individual quests within each campaign.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation between campaigns and quests.

### 3. User Progress Screen
- Comprehensive overview of the user's journey on StackUp.
- Quest Records: Detailed history of completed and ongoing quests.
- Bounty Records: Information on bounties attempted and completed.
- Filter functionality:
  - View ongoing quests and bounties
  - Access past quests and bounties

### 4. My Earnings
- Dedicated section displaying user's earnings information.
- Clear breakdown of rewards earned from various activities on the platform.
- Historical data of earnings over time.

### 5. Leaderboard (New Feature)
- Global leaderboard showcasing top performers on the platform.
- User rankings based on experience points (XP).
- XP calculation:
  - More quests completed = Higher XP
  - More bounties submitted = Higher XP
- Encouraging healthy competition and motivation among users.

### 6. Profile Screen
- Display of user's personal information.
- Showcase of professional details and achievements.
- Option to edit and update profile information.

## Purpose and Benefits

The StackUp mobile app concept aims to enhance user engagement and accessibility. By bringing the platform's features to a mobile environment, users can:

1. Stay connected with their learning progress on the go.
2. Receive real-time notifications about new quests and bounties.
3. Easily track their earnings and performance.
4. Engage in friendly competition through the leaderboard feature.
5. Manage their profile and professional information conveniently.

## Technical Considerations

While this README describes a conceptual mock-up, the actual development of the StackUp mobile app would involve:

- Choosing between native (iOS/Android) or cross-platform development frameworks.
- Ensuring secure authentication and data protection measures.
- Implementing efficient data synchronization between the mobile app and StackUp servers.
- Optimizing the app for performance across various mobile devices.

## Conclusion

The proposed StackUp mobile app mock-up represents an exciting opportunity to expand the platform's reach and enhance user experience. By combining existing features with new additions like the leaderboard, this concept aims to create a comprehensive, engaging, and user-friendly mobile application for the StackUp community.

We welcome feedback and suggestions to further refine this concept and potentially bring the StackUp mobile app to life in the future.
